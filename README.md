## FAQ

#### Question 1 : Difference between var, let, and const

Answer 1 : var: Function-scoped, can be re-declared    updated, hoisted (initialized with undefined).

let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared (value is constant, but objects/arrays can be mutated).

#### Question 2 : Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()

Answer 2 : map(): Returns a new array with transformed values.

forEach(): Iterates through array, does not return anything (used for side effects).

filter(): Returns a new array with elements that pass a condition.

#### Question 3 : What are arrow functions in ES6?
Answer 3 : Shorter syntax for writing functions:

const add = (a, b) => a + b;

this keyword is lexically bound (doesnâ€™t create its own this).

#### Question 4 :How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Answer 4 : Allows extracting values from arrays/objects into variables:

const [a, b] = [1, 2];  
const {name, age} = {name: "John", age: 25};

#### Question 5 : Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Answer 5 : Use backticks (`) for strings.

Support interpolation and multi-line strings:

const name = "Alice";  
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);


Difference: Easier and cleaner than string concatenation ("Hello " + name).
